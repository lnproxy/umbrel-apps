description: >-
  lnproxy is a simple privacy tool that makes invoices more private.
  Users of custodial Lightning wallets get better payment destination privacy
  and sovereign node runners with enhanced receiver privacy.
  lnproxy works like a "Poor man's rendez-vous",
  providing privacy for users without taking custody of their funds.
